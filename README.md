* An outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error , the latter are sometimes excluded from the data set. An outlier can cause serious problems in statistical analyses. In other words, it's data that lies outside the other values in the set.
